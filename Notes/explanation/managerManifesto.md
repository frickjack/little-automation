# TL;DR

What does a manager do?

## Overview

* Golden circule
    - why == mission
    - how == values, culture
    - what == current realization of why and how

* Why - software to empower the little people
    - small biz, government agencies, ngo's
    - affordable
    - not for profit

* Communicate values
    - love - for the team, clients, community
        * community - matching gift, voting, environment, local giving, engagement with schools, parks, government, etc
        * team - benefits, parental leave, time off - no burnout, promote from within
    - if we're not having fun, then we're doing it wrong
    - dog food - we use what we build, we don't deliver what we wouldn't want ourselves, ensure that our success is linked to the success of our users (ie - our clients are our users, not some intermediary)
    - diversity - we value diversity in our team, and maintain a safe, respectful work environment
    - data - we make decisions based on data, and collect metrics in everything we do
        * goals, performance, and compensation
        * product decisions - experiment, prototype
        * develop infrastructure for experimentation - test, collect metrics KPIs, evaluate results
    - lean out - do not commit to what we cannot reasonably deliver
    
* Love the team
    - Insulate from external pressures
    - Give credit, take blame
    - Remove blockers

* Set goals
    - Team goals
    - Individual goals

* Track performance
    - Metrics
    - Feedback
    - Weekly meetings

* Interact with clients
    - Metrics
    - Communicate progress toward goals
    - Take on work/responsibility

* Develop processes
    - note: processes have a lifetime - either evolve and change or are replaced over time as new needs, etc arise
