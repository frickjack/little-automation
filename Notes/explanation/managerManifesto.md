# TL;DR

What does a manager do?
This is such garbage.

## Overview

* Golden circle
    - why == mission
    - how == values, culture
    - what == current realization of why and how

* Why - software to empower the little people
    - small biz, government agencies, ngo's
    - affordable
    - not for profit

* Communicate values
    - love - for the team, clients, community
        * community - matching gift, voting, environment, local giving, engagement with schools, parks, government, etc
        * team - benefits, parental leave, time off - no burnout, promote from within
    - if we're not having fun, then we're doing it wrong
    - dog food - we use what we build, we don't deliver what we wouldn't want ourselves, ensure that our success is linked to the success of our users (ie - our clients are our users, not some intermediary)
    - diversity - we value diversity in our team, and maintain a safe, respectful work environment
    - data - we make decisions based on data, and collect metrics in everything we do
        * goals, performance, and compensation
        * product decisions - experiment, prototype
        * develop infrastructure for experimentation - test, collect metrics KPIs, evaluate results
    - lean out - do not commit to what we cannot reasonably deliver
    - every communication is positive 
        * every interaction between people should leave all parties fealing respected and listened to
        * say what you have to say, listen to responses, answer questions; do not berate
    
* Love the team
    - Insulate from external pressures
    - Give credit, take blame
    - Remove blockers
    - Promote, reward, help reach goals

* Set goals
    - Team goals
    - Individual goals

* Track performance
    - Metrics
    - Feedback
    - Weekly meetings

* Interact with clients
    - Metrics
    - Communicate progress toward goals
    - Take on work/responsibility

* Develop processes
    - an organization is a basket of processes (hiring, promotion, time off, customer relations, design, ...)
    

## Processes

Idea an organization has a hierarchy of processes - leverage, automation, Conway's Law.  Each process takes inputs, and generates output assets.
You cannot be proficient in all the processes.

Processes have a lifetime - either evolve and change or are replaced over time as new needs, etc arise

Processes embody culture.

* compensation, time off
* open communication
* product development and design - who, how
* dev
    - PR's
    - Lynting standards
    - Code review
    - unit test
* qa
    - test cycles
    - reports
    - test definition
* deploy
    - code promotion
* operation
    - monitoring
    - cell setup
    - tenant
* test
* customer relations
* sales
* payroll
* finance

An organization is a bucket of people, processes, and products, and must empower its people with processes and tools to produce great products.

## Overview

* Notes/ blog
* Features/ roadmap
* TestPlans/ qa
* Automation/ devsecops
* Burndown, performance tracking, scheduling
* SLI and SLO
* API and UX and Visual design
* Help and documentation
* Reports and dashboards

Processes exist in a hierarchy.  Higher level processes build on top of lower level processes with increasing degrees of automation moving down the stack.

* CI, unit testing, lynting, static analysis, code quality, dependency checking, code review, promotion process, version tracking, release notes, release management and CICD
* infrastructure management - release and rollback, patching - keeping things up to date, secrets management, configuration management, authn and authz, discovery, encryption, configuration management, ...
* Logging, monitoring, metrics and statistics, analytics, alerting and notifications
* Culture - values, incentives, career path, performance tracking
