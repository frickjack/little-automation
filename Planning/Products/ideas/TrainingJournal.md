# TL;DR

Training journal.  Anything that involves goals over time, and journaling of daily progress.

## Ideas

Ex: workouts, music practice, diet

Mechanisms to:

* set goal hierarchies, and associate lists, databases, documentation, discussion, calendars, kpi metrics, media, ... with goals - ex:
    - happy family / go on a vacation / plan the vacation -- destination options list
    - be healthy / good physical health / diet -- grocery list
    - be healthy / good physical health / exercise -- training journal
    - be healthy / mental health / stay in touch -- contacts db, birthday calendar
    - be healthy / mental health / have hobbies / guitar -- songs to learn list, practice journal
    - have good finances / save for retirement /
    - happy family / visit / parents
    - ...

* a goal moves between states, have a priority, ... - goal == project
* include coaches
* inspiration and motivation
* share experience
* calendar
* teams and individuals - goal hierarchy
* rewards
* notes for end of the day planning, review, etc
* Eisenhower prioritization matrix
* Day planning
* stackoverflow meets slack
* knowledge graph - ex: link name to entry in contacts list
* documentation 
    - ex: project goal 6 pager
    - ex: stackoverflow FAQ's
* discussion threads
* search
* track history and kpi/metrics

Knowledge graph?  Mind map?  Evernote?
