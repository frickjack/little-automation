# TL;DR

A system for publishing process guidelines.

## Discussion

From little-elements Notes/explanation/:

The "Bla Guide" model may work well for managing the interaction between other teams as well.  It is easy to imagine security, infrastructure and operations, hr, product management, and qa guidelines that are similar to UX guides in their complexity, tooling, and evolution.  Inevitably we will need "guidelines for guidelines".

Ex: UX guidelines - Design and developer teams need to work together to agree on a mental model for how a site is structured and operates, then codify that model in UX guidelines.  Implementing UX guidelines is an evolutionary process that include documentation at the high level of the approach to design, training material and SOPs that illustrate how the guidelines are applied, design tools, CSS baselines, component libraries, and SOP's for the processes that shape the teams' daily work.
